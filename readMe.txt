<-----------------------  Shape Sorting System  ----------------------->

Welcome to the Shape Sorting System! 
Here you're able to sort various sizes of arrays containing Shape Objects.
There are 6 sorts to choose from:
	Insert = i
	Selection = s
	Bubble = b
	Merge = m
	Quick = q 
	Gnome = z

Lists can be sorted by 1 of three variables:
	Height = h
	Volume = v
	Base Area = a

How To:
Run JAR file with three arguments
	1. "-f" then the file name where the array is located
	2. "-s" followed by the character representing the Sort you desire
	3. "-t" followed by the character representing the Sort Parameter you desire

Known Deficiency:
	Tried to work in a filename standardization from the arg but couldn't make it work so file name format 	must be "res\polyfor1".txt. The format -F"C:\temp\polyfor5.txt" will work if txt files are present in 	that location on host machine.
